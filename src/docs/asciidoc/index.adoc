== Snapshots

=== Once upon a time...

* Monolithic apps
* CVS, Perforce, ...
* Ant

=== Modularization

* Dependency management
** Maven
** Ivy
* Multi-project builds

== Monorepo vs multirepo

=== Monorepo pros

* All sources in single place
* Single lifecycle (sometimes a con)
* Easy refactorings
* Catch breaking changes early

=== Monorepo cons

* Build performance
** Configuration time for projects you don't need
** Build time for projects you don't need
* IDE integration
* `TooMuchCodeException`

=== Multirepo pros

* Focused
* Stronger encapsulation
* Clean component boundaries
* Independent lifecycle (sometimes a con)
* Build performance

=== Multirepo cons

* Requires integration
** Consumers need a way to get latest version
** Always needs to be published
* Breakages caught late

=== So here come snapshots!

* Multi-repo approach
* Allows consumer to consume _unreleased_ versions
* Problem solved!

(is it?)

== Why snapshots are evil

=== What's wrong with this?

```
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.acme:awesome-lib:1+'
}
```

=== Or this?

```
mavenLocal() // evil!
```

=== Or this?

```
dependencies {
    // Everytime someone publishes a snapshot, a kitten dies
    implementation 'com.acme:awesome-lib:1.2-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

=== Builds should be reproducible

* Anybody, anytime, should be able to:
** Produce the same output for the same input
** Share the results in a repository-agnostic way (build cache)
* Snapshots are worse than dynamic versions
** Same version number, different artifacts
* No traceability
** At best, a timestamp if it's published
** At worse, no clue (`mavenLocal()`)

=== Snapshots and dynamic versions are performance killers

* Periodically look into repositories
* Cache policy (reproducible?)
* Maven: a snapshot can change _during_ a build
** No proper resolution of sub-module artifacts (identified by _version_)
** Cache timeout

=== Maven vs Gradle

----
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.acme</groupId>
       <artifactId>awesome-lib</groupId>
       <version>1.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>

vs

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation project(':awesome-lib')
}
----

== Here come composite builds!

=== Binary vs source

* Properly separate binaries from sources
* Binaries are published
* Published = released

=== Simple idea

* Integration through binaries or sources
* On demand

[source,groovy]
----
rootProject.name = 'my-app'
includeBuild '../my-lib'
----

=== Substitute a binary dependency with source

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.acme.awesome-lib:1.1' // binary dependency
}
----

```
includeBuild '../my-lib' // replaces the binary dependency
```

== Demo : Basic example

== Demo : multirepo

== Demo : Plugin development

== How does it work?

* Built upon _dependency substitution_
* Replaces any dependency with the included build
* Participates in the dependency graph

== Build cache

=== The Gradle build cache

* Released with Gradle 3.5
* Caches outputs of tasks
** local cache
** remote cache
** cache backend provided with Gradle Enterprise

=== The Gradle build cache demo

== CI Integration

=== Snapshots and CI

* Can setup composite builds on CI
** allows discovering breakages early
* Enable build cache!

[source,groovy]
----
ext.isCiServer = System.getenv().containsKey("CI")

buildCache {
    local {
        enabled = !isCiServer
    }
    remote(HttpBuildCache) {
        url = 'https://example.com:8123/build-cache/'
        push = isCiServer
    }
}
----

== Limitations of composite builds

* No nested composites (coming soon!)
* Cannot access tasks from included builds from CLI (coming soon!)
* Cannot substitute with custom publication
* Continuous builds won't detect changes to included builds
* No build scans (coming soon!)


== Conclusion

=== Are snapshots dead?

* Not yet
** Still useful for development version number
** Can still be pushed to remote repositories
* But we should use timestamped versions
** For reproducible builds
* Composites remove almost all cons of snapshots
